Hi everyone. I'm Allison, a sophomore in Informatics. I love photography, especially street and landscape photography. I also enjoy hiking and reading. This is my first quarter being a TA for CSE 373, and I look forward to meeting everyone this quarter. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!
