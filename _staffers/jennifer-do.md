Hi there! I'm Jennifer, a senior majoring in Informatics. I enjoy exploring new places, collecting blind box figures, and doing anything creative like sketching in my free time. This will be my first time TAing for CSE 373 so I'm excited to meet and work with you all this quarter! Please feel free to reach out to me about anything! :)
