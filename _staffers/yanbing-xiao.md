Hi everyone, I am Yanbing! I am a rising Junior studying Electrical Engineering. I am very excited to be a teaching assistant for CSE373 in the Winter of 2023. I have zero experience in teaching CSE. But I promise I will try my best to provide help to all of you. I love questions! Feel free to email me with any questions. Outside of academics, I love exercising and doing yoga. I love Szechuan cuisine and Dim Sum.
